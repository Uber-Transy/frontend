# üöÄ Uber for Teens - Secure Pickup & Tracking App

This project is a mobile application that allows parents to arrange secure transportation for their teens / students and track their movement in real-time. It is designed to provide peace of mind to parents by monitoring and ensuring that teens get home safely from school or other activities.

The backend is built with **Flask** and handles API requests, user authentication, and real-time tracking, while the frontend is developed using **React Native**, providing a cross-platform mobile app experience.

## üõ† Tech Stack

### Backend (API)
- **Flask**: Python microframework for handling HTTP requests and backend logic.
- **Flask-Restful**: For creating RESTful APIs.
- **Flask-JWT-Extended**: For secure user authentication with JWT tokens.
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for interacting with the database.
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for storing user information, trip details, etc.
- **Flask-SocketIO**: For real-time communication (e.g., live tracking of the teen's location).

### Frontend (Mobile App)
- **React Native**: For building the cross-platform mobile application (iOS & Android).
- **React Navigation**: Navigation system for the app.
- **Redux**: State management for handling app-wide states (e.g., user authentication, trip data).
- **Axios**: HTTP client for making API requests to the Flask backend.
- **Socket.IO**: For real-time tracking of the teen‚Äôs location on the app.
- **Google Maps API**: For rendering the map and showing the teen‚Äôs location.

## üåü Features

1. **User Roles**:
   - **Parents**: Can schedule rides, track their teens, and view trip history.
   - **Teens**: Can view ride details, estimated arrival time, and notify parents when they arrive.
   - **Drivers**: Assigned to pick up teens and responsible for safely transporting them.

2. **Secure Authentication**:
   - Users (Parents, Teens, Drivers) can register and log in using secure JWT authentication.

3. **Real-Time Tracking**:
   - Parents can track their teen's live location from school to home in real-time via the app.

4. **Ride Scheduling**:
   - Parents can schedule rides for their teens and receive notifications when the driver is on the way and when the teen has arrived.

5. **Notifications**:
   - Push notifications to alert parents when the ride has started, during transit, and when the teen reaches home.

6. **Payment Integration**:
   - Parents can securely pay for rides through integrated payment gateways.

7. **Data Protection**:
   - Ensure compliance with data protection regulations, keeping all user data secure.
